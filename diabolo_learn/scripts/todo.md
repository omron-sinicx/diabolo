- decide input of diabolo manipulation
    - stick position or delta stick position
- apply analytical model of diabolo position (and also diabolo rotation?) to `diabolo_env.py`
- implement and train learning-based model of diabolo orientation
- apply it to `diabolo_env.py`
- consider how to combine analytical model of diabolo position and learning-based model of diabolo orientation
    - Does is work well just simulating those two models independantly at the same time?
