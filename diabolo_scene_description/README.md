# Introduction

This package contains the description of our robot system and scene. The `meshes` folder also contains the STL files to 3D print the attachment for the diabolo sticks. They require M4 screws and nuts (at least 10 mm length) to attach together, and long M6 screws to attach to the Robotiq gripper.
